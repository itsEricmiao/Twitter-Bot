THE BUTLER, recognizing her ladyship's only surviving brother at a glance,as he afterward informed his less percipient subordinates, favored Sir Horacewith a low bow, and took it upon himself to say that my lady, although not athome to less nearly connected persons, would be happy to see him. SirHorace, unimpressed by this condescension, handed his caped greatcoat toone footman, his hat and cane to the other, tossed his gloves onto the marbletoppedtable, and said that he had no doubt of that, and how was Dassettkeeping these days? The butler, torn between gratification at having his nameremembered and disapproval of Sir Horace's free and easy ways, said that hewas as well as could be expected, and happy (if he might venture to say so) tosee Sir Horace looking not a day older than when he had last had the pleasureof announcing him to her ladyship. He then led the way, in a very statelymanner, up the imposing stairway to the Blue Saloon, where Lady Ombersleywas dozing gently on a sofa by the fire, a Paisley shawl spread over her feet,and her cap decidedly askew. Mr. Dassett, observing these details, coughed,and made his announcement in commanding accents: "Sir Horace Stanton-Lacy, my lady!"Lady Ombersley awoke with a start, stared for an uncomprehending moment,made an ineffective clutch at her cap, and uttered a faint shriek. "Horace!""Hallo, Lizzie, how are you?" said Sir Horace, walking across the room, andbestowing an invigorating buffet upon her shoulder."Good heavens, what a fright you gave me!" exclaimed her ladyship, uncorkingthe vinaigrette which was never out of her reach.The butler, having tolerantly observed these transports, closed the door uponthe reunited brother and sister, and went away to disclose to his underlingsthat Sir Horace was a gentleman as lived much abroad, being, as he wasinformed, employed by the government on diplomatic business too delicatefor their understanding.The diplomatist, meanwhile, warming his coattails by the fire, refreshedhimself with a pinch of snuff and told his sister that she was putting onweight. "Not growing any younger, either of us," he added handsomely. "Notbut what I can give you five years, Lizzie, unless my memory's at fault, which Idon't think it is."There was a large gilded mirror on the wall opposite the fireplace, and as hespoke Sir Horace allowed his gaze to rest upon his own image, not in aconceited spirit, but with critical approval. His forty-five years had treatedhim kindly. If his outline had thickened a little his height, which was wellabove six feet, made a slight portliness negligible. He was a very fine figure ofa man, and had, besides a large and well-proportioned frame, a handsomecountenance, topped by luxuriant brown locks as yet unmarred by silverstreaks. He was always dressed with elegance, but was far too wise a man toadopt such extravagances of fashion, as could only show up the imperfectionsof a middle-aged figure. "Take a look at poor Prinny!" said Sir Horace to lessdiscriminating cronies. "He's a lesson to us all!"His sister accepted the implied criticism unresentfully. Twenty-seven years ofwedlock had left their mark upon her; and the dutiful presentation to hererratic and far from grateful spouse of eight pledges of her affection had longsince destroyed any pretensions to beauty in her. Her health was indifferent,her disposition compliant, and she was fond of saying that when one was agrandmother it was time to be done with thinking of one's appearance."How's Ombersley?" asked Sir Horace, with more civility than interest."He feels his gout a little, but considering everything he is remarkably well,"she responded.Sir Horace took a mere figure of speech in an undesirably literal spirit, saying,with a nod, "Always did drink too much. Still, he must be going on for sixtynow, and I don't suppose you have so much of the other trouble, do you?""No, no!" said his sister hastily. Lord Ombersley's infidelities, thoughmortifying when conducted, as they too often were, in the full glare ofpublicity, had never greatly troubled her, but she had no desire to discussthem with her outspoken relative, and gave the conversation an abrupt turnby asking where he had come from."Lisbon," he replied, taking another pinch of snuff.Lady Ombersley was vaguely surprised. It was now two years since the closeof the long Peninsular War, and she rather thought that when last heard ofSir Horace had been in Vienna, no doubt taking mysterious part in theCongress, which had been so rudely interrupted by the escape of that dreadfulMonster from Elba. "Oh!" she said, a little blankly. "Of course, you have ahouse there! I was forgetting! And how is dear Sophia?""As a matter of fact," said Sir Horace, shutting his snuffbox, and restoring itto his pocket, "it's about Sophy that I've come to see you."Sir Horace had been a widower for fifteen years, during which period he hadneither requested his sister's help in rearing his daughter nor paid the leastheed to her unsolicited advice, but at these words an uneasy feeling stole overher. She said, "Yes, Horace? Dear little Sophia! It must be four years ormore since I saw her. How old is she now? I suppose she must be almostout?""Been out for years," responded Sir Horace. "Never anything else, really.She's twenty.""Twenty!" exclaimed Lady Ombersley. She applied her mind to arithmetic,and said, "Yes, she must be, for my own Cecilia is just turned nineteen, and Iremember that your Sophia was born almost a year before. Dear me, yes!Poor Marianne! What a lovely creature she was, to be sure!"With a slight effort Sir Horace conjured up the vision of his dead wife. "Yes,so she was," he agreed. "One forgets, you know. Sophy's not much like her--favors me!""I know what a comfort she must have been to you," sighed Lady Ombersley."And I'm sure, dear Horace, that nothing could be more affecting than yourdevotion to the child!""I wasn't in the least devoted," interrupted Sir Horace. "I shouldn't have kepther with me if she'd been troublesome. Never was. Good little thing, Sophy!""Yes, my dear, no doubt, but to be dragging a little girl all over Spain andPortugal, when she would have been far better in a select school--""Not she! She'd have learned to be missish," said Sir Horace cynically."Besides, no use to prose to me now on that head--it's too late! The thing is,Lizzie, I'm in something of a fix. I want you to take care of Sophy while I'm inSouth America.""South America?" gasped Lady Ombersley."Brazil. I don't expect to be away for very long, but I can't take my littleSophy, and I can't leave her with Tilly because Tilly's dead. Died in Vienna,couple of years ago. A devilish inconvenient thing to do, but I daresay shedidn't mean it.""Tilly?" said Lady Ombersley, all at sea."Lord, Elizabeth, don't keep on repeating everything I say! Shocking badhabit! Miss Tillingham, Sophy's governess!""Good heavens! Do you mean to tell me that the child has no governessnow?""Of course she has not! She don't need a governess. I always found plenty ofchaperons for her when we were in Paris, and in Lisbon it don't signify. But Ican't leave her alone in England.""Indeed, I should think not! But, my dearest Horace, though I would doanything to oblige you, I am not quite sure--""Nonsense!" said Sir Horace bracingly. "She'll be a nice companion for yourgirl--what's her name? Cecilia? Dear little soul, you know--not an ounce ofvice in her!"This fatherly tribute made his sister blink, and utter a faint protest. SirHorace paid no heed to it. "What's more, she won't cause you any trouble,"he said. "She has her head well on her shoulders, my Sophy. I never worryabout her."An intimate knowledge of her brother's character made it perfectly possiblefor Lady Ombersley to believe this, but since she herself was blessed withmuch the same easygoing temperament no acid comment even rose to herlips. "I am sure she must be a dear girl," she said. "But, you see, Horace--""And another thing is that it's time we were thinking of a husband for her,"pursued Sir Horace, seating himself in a chair on the opposite side of thefireplace. "I knew I could depend on you. Dash it, you're her aunt! My onlysister, too.""I should be only too happy to bring her out," said Lady Ombersley wistfully."But the thing is I don't think--I am rather afraid-- You see, what with thereally dreadful expense of presenting Cecilia last year, and dearest Maria'swedding only a little time before that, and Hubert's going up to Oxford, not tomention the fees at Eton for poor Theodore--""If it's expense that bothers you, Lizzie, you needn't give it a thought, for I'llstand the nonsense. You won't have to present her at Court--I'll attend to allthat when I come home, and if you don't want to be put to the trouble of itthen I can find some other lady to do it. What I want at this present is for herto go about with her cousins, meet the right set of people--you know the styleof thing!""Of course I know, and as for trouble it would be no such thing! But I cannothelp feeling that perhaps, perhaps it would not do! We do not entertain verymuch.""Well, with a pack of girls on your hands you ought to," said Sir Horacebluntly."But, Horace, I have not got a pack of girls on my hands!" protested LadyOmbersley. "Selina is only sixteen, and Gertrude and Amabel are barely outof the nursery!""I see what it is," said Sir Horace indulgently. "You're afraid she may take theshine out of Cecilia. No, no, my dear! I daresay you'll think she's a verypretty girl. But Cecilia's something quite out of the common way. Rememberthinking so when I saw her last year. I was surprised, for you were neverabove the average yourself, Lizzie, while I always thought Ombersley a plainlookingfellow."His sister accepted these strictures meekly, but was quite distressed that heshould suppose her capable of harboring such unhandsome thoughts abouther niece. "And even if I was so odious, there is no longer the least need forsuch notions," she added. "Nothing has as yet been announced, Horace, but Idon't scruple to tell you that Cecilia is about to contract a very eligiblealliance.""That's good," said Sir Horace. "You'll have leisure to look about you for ahusband for Sophy. You won't have any difficulty. She's a taking little thing,and she'll have a snug fortune one of these days, besides what her mother lefther. No need to be afraid of her marrying to disoblige us, either. She's asensible girl, and she's been about the world enough to be well up to snuff.Whom have you got for Cecilia?""Lord Charlbury has asked Ombersley's permission to address her," said hissister, swelling a little with pride."Charlbury, eh?" said Sir Horace. "Very well indeed, Elizabeth! I must say, Ididn't think you'd catch much of a prize, because looks aren't everything, andfrom the way Ombersley was running through his fortune when I last sawhim--""Lord Charlbury," said Lady Ombersley a little stiffly, "is an extremely wealthyman, and, I know, has no such vulgar consideration in mind. Indeed, he toldme himself that it was a case of love at first sight with him!""Capital!" said Sir Horace. "I should suppose him to have been hanging out fora wife for some time--thirty at least, ain't he? But if he has a veritable tendrefor the girl, so much the better! It should fix his interest with her.""Yes," agreed Lady Ombersley. "And I am persuaded they will suit very well.He is everything that is amiable and obliging, his manners mostgentlemanlike, his understanding decidedly superior, and his person such asmust please."Sir Horace, who was not much interested in his niece's affairs, said, "Well,well, he is plainly a paragon, and we must allow Cecilia to think herselffortunate to be forming such a connection! I hope you may manage as prettilyfor Sophy!""Indeed, I wish I might!" she responded, sighing. "Only it is an awkwardmoment, because--the thing is, you see, that I am afraid Charles may not quitelike it!"Sir Horace frowned in an effort of memory. "I thought his name was Bernard.Why shouldn't he like it?""I am not speaking of Ombersley, Horace. You must remember Charles!""If you're talking about that eldest boy of yours, of course I remember him!But what right has he to say anything, and why the devil should he object tomy Sophy?""Oh, no, not to her! I am sure he could not do so! But I fear he may not likeit if we are to be plunged into gaiety just now! I daresay you may not haveseen the announcement of his own approaching marriage, but I should tellyou that he has contracted an engagement to Miss Wraxton.""What, not old Brinklow's daughter? Upon my word, Lizzie, you have beenbusy to some purpose! Never knew you had so much sense! Eligible, indeed!You are to be congratulated!""Yes," said Lady Ombersley. "Oh, yes! Miss Wraxton is a most superior girl.I am sure she has a thousand excellent qualities. A most well-informed mind,and principles such as must command respect.""She sounds to me like a dead bore," said Sir Horace frankly."Charles," said Lady Ombersley, staring mournfully into the fire, "does notcare for very lively girls, or--or for any extravagant folly. I own, I could wishMiss Wraxton had rather more vivacity. But you are not to regard that,Horace, for I had never the least inclination toward being a bluestockingmyself, and in these days, when so many young females are wild to a fault, it isgratifying to find one who-- Charles thinks Miss Wraxton's air of gravereflection very becoming!" she ended, in rather a hurry."You know, Lizzie, it's a queer thing that any son of yours and Ombersleyshould have grown into such a dull stick," remarked Sir Horacedispassionately. "I suppose you didn't play Ombersley false, did you?""Horace!""No, I know you didn't! No need to fly into a pucker! Not with your eldest;you know better than that! Still, it is an odd circumstance--often thought so!He can marry his bluestocking, and welcome, for anything I care, but none ofthis explains why you should be caring a fig for what he likes or don't like!"Lady Ombersley transferred her gaze from the glowing coals to his face. "Youdo not perfectly understand, Horace.""That's what I said!" he retorted."Yes, but--Horace, Matthew Rivenhall left his whole fortune to Charles!"Sir Horace was generally accounted an astute man, but he appeared to find itdifficult correctly to assimilate this information. He stared fixedly at his sisterfor a moment or two, and then said, "You don't mean that old uncle ofOmbersley?""Yes, I do.""The nabob?"Lady Ombersley nodded, but her brother was still not satisfied. "Fellow whomade a fortune in India?""Yes, and we always thought--but he said Charles was the only Rivenhall otherthan himself who had the least grain of sense, and he left him everything,Horace! Everything!""Good God!"This ejaculation seemed to appear to Lady Ombersley as fitting, for shenodded again, looking at her brother in a woebegone fashion, and twisting thefringe of her shawl between her fingers."So it is Charles who calls the tune!" said Sir Horace."No one could have been more generous," said Lady Ombersley unhappily."We cannot but be sensible of it.""Damn his impudence!" said Sir Horace, himself a father. "What's he done?""Well, Horace, you might not know it, because you are always abroad, butpoor Ombersley had a great many debts.""Everyone knows that! Never knew him when he wasn't under a cloud!You're not going to tell me the boy was fool enough to settle 'em?""But, Horace, someone had to settle them!" she protested. "You can have nonotion how difficult things were becoming! And with the younger boys toestablish creditably, and the dear girls-- It is no wonder that Charles shouldbe so anxious that Cecilia should make a good match!""Providing for the whole pack, is he? More fool he! What about themortgages? If the greater part of Ombersley's inheritance had not beenentailed he would have gambled the whole away long since!""I do not properly understand entails," said his sister, "but I am afraid thatCharles did not behave just as he should over it. Ombersley was very muchdispleased, though I shall always say that to call one's first-born a serpent'stooth is to use quite unbecoming language! It seems that when Charles cameof age he might have made everything quite easy for his poor papa, if only hehad been in the least degree obliging! But nothing would prevail upon him toagree to break the entail, so all was at a standstill, and one cannot blameOmbersley for being vexed! And then that odious old man died.""When?" demanded Sir Horace. "How comes it that I never heard a word ofthis before today?""It was rather more than two years ago, and--""That accounts for it, then. I was devilish busy, dealing with Angouleme, andall that set. Must have happened at the time of Toulouse, I dare swear. Butwhen I saw you last year you never spoke a word, Lizzie!"She was stung by the injustice of this, and said indignantly, "I am sure I don'tknow how I should have been thinking of such paltry things, with thatMonster at large, and the Champs de Mars, and the banks suspendingpayment, and heaven knows what beside! And you coming over from Brusselswithout a word of warning, and sitting with me a bare twenty minutes! Myhead was in a whirl, and if I answered you to the point it is more than I wouldhave bargained for!"Sir Horace, disregarding this irrelevancy, said, with what for him was strongfeeling, "Outrageous! I don't say Ombersley's not a shocking loose screw,because there's no sense in wrapping plain facts up in clean linen, but to becutting a man out of one's will and setting up his son to lord it over him,which I'll be bound he does!""No, no!" expostulated Lady Ombersley feebly. "Charles is fully sensible ofwhat is due to his father! It is not that he is ever lacking in respect, I doassure you! Only poor Ombersley cannot but feel it a little, now that Charleshas taken everything into his own hands.""A pretty state of affairs!""Yes, but one comfort is that it is not generally known. And I cannot denythat in some ways it is by far more pleasant. You would scarcely credit it,Horace, but I do believe there is not an unpaid bill in the house!" A moment'sreflection caused her to modify this statement. "At least, I cannot answer forOmbersley, but all those dreadful household accounts, which Eckington--youremember our good Eckington, Ombersley's agent--used to pull such a faceover; and the fees at Eton and Oxford--everything, my dear brother, Charlestakes care of!""You aren't going to tell me Charles is fool enough to fritter away old MattRivenhall's fortune paying all the expenses of this barrack of a house!"exclaimed Sir Horace."No. Oh, no! I have not the least head for business, so it is of no use to askme to explain it to you, but I believe that Charles persuaded his father to--toallow him to administer the estate.""Blackmailed him into it, more like!" said Sir Horace grimly. "Rare times welive in! Mind, I see the boy's point, Lizzie, but, by God, I'm sorry for you!""Oh, pray believe it's no such thing!" cried Lady Ombersley, distressed. "I didnot wish you to think--to give you cause to suppose that Charles is everdisagreeable, for indeed he is not, except when he is put out of temper, andone must own that he has a great deal to try his patience! Which is why Ican't but feel, dear Horace, that if he does not like me to take charge ofSophia for you, I ought not to tease him!""Fiddlesticks!" said Sir Horace. "And why shouldn't he like it?""We--we had decided not to give any parties this season, beyond what must bethought necessary. It is a most unfortunate circumstance that Charles'swedding has had to be postponed, on account of a bereavement Miss Wraxtonhas suffered. One of Lady Brinklow's sisters, and they will not be out of blackgloves for six months. You must know that the Brinklows are very particularin all matters of correct conduct. Eugenia goes only to very quiet parties,and--and naturally one must expect Charles to partake of her sentiments!""Lord, Elizabeth, a man don't have to wear black gloves for the aunt of afemale he ain't even married to!""Of course not, but Charles seemed to feel--and then there is Charlbury!""What the devil ails him?""Mumps," replied Lady Ombersley tragically."Eh?" Sir Horace burst out laughing. "Well, what a fellow he must be to havethe mumps when he should be getting married to Cecilia!""Really, Horace, I must say that I think that most unjust of you, for how couldhe help it? It is so mortifying for him! And, what is more, excessivelyunfortunate, because I don't doubt that had he been able to attach Cecilia,which I am sure he must have done, for nothing could be more amiable thanhis disposition, while his manners and address are just what they ought to be!But girls are so foolish, and take romantical notions into their heads, besidesall kinds of encroaching fancies. However, I am happy to think that Cecilia isnot one of these dreadful modern misses, and of course she will be guided byher parents! But no one can deny that nothing could be more ill timed thanCharlbury's mumps!"Sir Horace, once more opening his snuffbox, regarded her with an amusedand sapient eye. "And what is Miss Cecilia's particular encroaching fancy?" heenquired.Lady Ombersley knew that her eldest son would have counseled her topreserve a discreet silence; but the impulse to unburden herself to her brotherwas too strong to be denied. She said, "Well, you will not repeat it, I know,Horace, but the fact is that the silly child thinks she is in love with AugustusFawnhope!""Would that be one of Lutterworth's brood?" asked Sir Horace. "I don't thinkmuch of that for a match, I must say!""Good heavens, don't mention such a thing! The youngest son, too, with notthe least expectation in the world! But he is a poet.""Very dangerous," agreed Sir Horace. "Don't think I ever saw the boy.What's he like?""Quite beautiful!" said Lady Ombersley, in despairing accents."What, in the style of Lord Byron? That fellow has a great deal to answerfor!""N-no. I mean, he is as fair as Cecilia is herself, and he doesn't limp, andthough his poems are very pretty, bound up in white velum, they don't seemto take very well. I mean, not at all like Lord Byron's. It seems sadly unjust,for I believe it cost a great deal of money to have them printed, and he had tobear the whole--or, rather, Lady Lutterworth did, according to what I haveheard.""Now that I come to think of it," said Sir Horace, "I do know the boy. He waswith Stuart in Brussels last year. If you take my advice you'll marry her off toCharlbury as quickly as you can!""Well, and so I would, if only--that is to say, of course I would not, if I thoughtshe held him in aversion! And you must see, Horace, that it is quite out of mypower to do anything of the sort when he is in bed with the mumps!"Sir Horace shook his head. "She will marry the poet.""Do not say so! But Charles thinks that I should do wisely not to take herwhere she is bound to meet the young man, which is another reason why weare living in a quiet style for the present. It is of all things the most awkward!Indeed, sometimes I feel that it would be much easier if the wretched creaturewere quite ineligible--a fortune hunter, or a merchant's son, or something ofthat nature! One could then forbid him the house, and forbid Cecilia to standup with him at balls, only it would not be in the least necessary, for we shouldnever meet him in society. But naturally one meets the Fawnhopeseverywhere! Nothing could be more provoking! And although I am sureCharles's manner towards him is most repellent, even he acknowledges theimpropriety of being so repulsive to him as to offend his family. AlmeriaLutterworth is one of my oldest friends!"Sir Horace, who was already bored with the subject, yawned, and said lazily, "Idaresay there is no occasion for you to be on the fidgets. The Fawnhopes areall as poor as church mice, and very likely Lady Lutterworth desires thematch as little as you do.""Nothing of the sort!" she replied, quite crossly. "She is foolish beyondpermission, Horace! Whatever Augustus wants he must have! She has givenme the most unmistakable hints, so that I scarcely knew where to look, muchless what to say, except that Lord Charlbury had requested our leave toaddress Cecilia, and I believed her to be--well, not indifferent to him! It neverentered my head that Augustus was so lost to all sense of propriety as to applyto Cecilia without first approaching Ombersley, yet that is precisely what hehas done!""Oh, well!" said Sir Horace. "If she has such a fancy for him, you had betterlet her take him. It's not as though she would be marrying beneath her, and ifshe chooses to be the wife of a penniless younger son it is quite her ownaffair.""You would not say so if it were Sophia!" said his sister."Sophy's not such a fool.""Cecilia is not a fool either!" declared Lady Ombersley, affronted. "If youhave seen Augustus you cannot wonder at her! No one could help feeling adecided partiality for him! I own, I did myself. But Charles is quite right, as Iwas soon brought to acknowledge; it would not answer!""Ah, well, when she has her cousin to keep her company it will divert her, andvery likely give her thoughts another direction," said Sir Horace consolingly.Lady Ombersley appeared to be much struck by this suggestion. Her facebrightened; she said: "I wonder if it might be so? She is a little shy, you mustknow, and does not make friends easily, and since her dear friend, MissFriston, was married, and has gone to live in the Midlands, there is really noyoung female with whom she is upon terms of intimacy. Now, if we had dearSophia to stay with us..." She broke off, obviously turning plans over in hermind. She was still engaged on this exercise when the door opened, and hereldest son entered the salon.The Honorable Charles Rivenhall was twenty-six years old, but a rather harshfeaturedcountenance, coupled with a manner that combined assurance with agood deal of reserve, made him give the impression of being some years older.He was a tall, powerfully built young man, who looked as though he wouldhave been better pleased to have been striding over his father's acres thanexchanging civilities in his mother's sitting room. He nearly always woreriding dress in preference to the more fashionable pantaloons and Hessians,tied his cravat in the plainest of styles, would permit only a modicum of starchto stiffen his very moderate shirt points, wholly disdained such fopperies asseals, fobs, or quizzing glasses, and offended his tailor by insisting on havinghis coats cut so that he could shrug himself into them without the assistanceof his valet. He had been heard to express the hope that heaven would forbidhe should ever be mistaken for one of the dandy set, but, as his friend Mr.Cyprian Wychbold kindly pointed out to him, there was not the least need forheavenly intervention in the matter. The dandies, said Mr. Wychbold withsome severity, were distinguished as much for their polished address as fortheir exquisite apparel, and were in general an amiable set of men, whosepolite manners and winning graces made them acceptable in any drawingroom. As Mr. Rivenhall's notion of making himself agreeable in company wasto treat with cold civility anyone for whom he felt no particular liking, and hisgraces, far from winning, included a trick of staring out of countenance thosewho pretensions he deprecated, and of uttering blighting comments which putan abrupt end to social intercourse, he stood in far greater danger (Mr.Wychbold said) of being mistaken for a Yahoo.As he shut the door behind him, his mother looked up, started slightly, andsaid with a nervous inflection which annoyed her brother: "Oh! Charles!Only fancy! Your uncle Horace!""So Dassett informed me," responded Mr. Rivenhall. "How do you do, sir?"He shook hands with his uncle, drew up a chair, and sat down, civillyengaging Sir Horace in conversation. His mother, fidgeting first with thefringe of her shawl and then with her handkerchief, presently broke in onthis interchange to say, "Charles, you remember Sophia? Your little cousin!"Mr. Rivenhall did not present the appearance of one who remembered hislittle cousin, but he said in his cool way, "Certainly. I hope she is well, sir?""Never had a day's illness in her life, barring the measles," said Sir Horace."You'll see her for yourself soon; your mother is going to take charge of herwhile I'm in Brazil."It was plain that this way of breaking the news did not recommend itself toLady Ombersley, who at once hurried into speech. "Well, of course it is notquite decided yet, though I am sure there is nothing I should like better thanto have my dear brother's daughter to stay with me. I was thinking, too,Charles, that it would be so pleasant for Cecilia. Sophia and she are nearlythe same age, you know.""Brazil?" said Mr. Rivenhall. "That should be very interesting, I daresay. Doyou make a long stay there, sir?""Oh, no!" replied Sir Horace vaguely. "Probably not. It will depend uponcircumstance. I have been telling your mother that I shall be much in herdebt if she can find an eligible husband for my Sophy. It's time she wasmarried, and your mother seems, from what I hear, to be quite a dab in thatline. I understand I have to offer you my felicitations, my boy?""Thank you, yes," said Mr. Rivenhall, with a slight bow."If you should not dislike it, Charles, I own I should be very happy to haveSophia," said Lady Ombersley placatingly.He cast her an impatient glance, and replied, "I beg you will do precisely asyou wish, ma'am. I cannot conceive what business it is of mine.""Of course I have explained to your uncle that we lead very quiet lives.""She won't give a fig for that," said Sir Horace comfortably. "She's a goodlittle thing, never at a loss for something to occupy herself with. Just as happyin a Spanish village as in Vienna, or Brussels."At this, Lady Ombersley sat up with a jerk. "Do not tell me you dragged thechild to Brussels last year!""Of course she was in Brussels! Where the devil should she have been?"replied Sir Horace testily. "You wouldn't have had me leave her in, Vienna,would you? Besides, she enjoyed it. We met a great many old friends there.""The danger!""Oh, pooh! Nonsense! Precious little of that with Wellington in command!""When, sir, may we have the pleasure of expecting my cousin?" interposed Mr.Rivenhall. "We must hope that she will not find life in London too humdrumafter the superior excitements of the Continent.""Not she!" said Sir Horace. "I never knew Sophy when she wasn't busy withsome ploy or another. Give her her head! I always do, and she never comesto any harm. Don't quite know when she'll be with you. She's bound to wantto see the last of me, but she'll post up to London as soon as I've sailed.""Post up to London as soon as--Horace, surely you will bring her to me!"gasped his sister, quite scandalized. "A girl of her age, traveling alone! I neverheard of such a thing!""Won't be alone. She'll have her maid with her--dragon of a woman, she is;journeyed all over Europe with us--and John Potton as well." He caught sightof his nephew's raised brows, and felt himself impelled to add: "Groom,courier, general factotum! Looked after Sophy since she was a baby." Hedrew out his watch, and consulted it. "Well, now that we've settledeverything, I must be off, Lizzie. I shall rely upon you to take care of Sophy,and look about you for a match. It's important, because--but I've no time toexplain that now! She'll tell you all about it, I expect.""But, Horace, we have not settled everything!" protested his sister. "AndOmbersley will be disappointed not to see you! I hoped you would dine withus!""No, I can't do that," he replied. "I'm dining at Carlton House. You may givemy respects to Ombersley; daresay I shall see him again one of these days!"He then kissed her in a perfunctory style, bestowed another of his hearty patsupon her shoulder, and took himself off, followed by his nephew. "Just as if Ihad nothing more to wish for!" Lady Ombersley said indignantly, whenCharles came back into the room. "And I have not the least notion when thatchild is to come to me!""It doesn't signify," said Charles, with an indifference she found exasperating."You will give orders for a room to be prepared for her, I suppose, and shemay come when she pleases. It's to be hoped Cecilia likes her, since I imagineshe will be obliged to see the most of her.""Poor little thing!" sighed Lady Ombersley. "I declare I quite long to motherher, Charles! What a strange, lonely life she must lead!""Strange certainly; hardly lonely, if she has been acting hostess for my uncle.I must suppose that she has had some elder lady to live with her-a governess,or some such thing.""Indeed, one would think it must have been so, but your uncle distinctly toldme that the governess died when they were in Vienna! I do not like to saysuch a thing of my only brother, but really it seems as though Horace is quiteunfit to have the care of a daughter!""Extremely unfit," he said dryly. "I trust you will not have cause to regret yourkindness, Mama.""Oh, no, I am sure I shall not!" she said. "Your uncle spoke of her in such away that gave me the greatest desire to welcome her! Poor child, I fear shehas not been used to have her wishes or her comfort much considered! Icould almost have been angry with Horace when he would keep on telling methat she is a good little thing, and had never been a worry to him! I daresayhe has never allowed anyone to be a worry to him, for a more selfish man Ibelieve you could hardly meet! Sophia must have her poor mother's sweetdisposition. I have no doubt of her being a charming companion for Cecilia.""I hope so," said Charles. "And that reminds me, Mama! I have justintercepted another of that puppy's floral offerings to my sister. This billetwas attached to it."Lady Ombersley took the proffered missive, and looked at it in dismay. "Whatshall I do with it?" she asked."Put it on the fire," he recommended."Oh, no, I could not, Charles! It might be quite unexceptionable! Besides--why, it might even contain a message from his mother for me!""Highly unlikely, but if you think that, you had better read it.""Of course, I know it is my duty to do so," she agreed unhappily.He looked rather contemptuous, but said nothing, and after a moment'sindecision she broke the seal, and spread open the single sheet. "Oh, dear, itis a poem!" she announced. "I must say, it is very pretty. Listen, Charles!'Nymph, when thy mild cerulean gaze Upon my restless spirit casts its beam--'""I thank you, I have no taste for verse!" interrupted Mr. Rivenhall harshly."Put it on the fire, ma'am, and tell Cecilia she is not to be receiving letterswithout your sanction!""Yes, but do you think I should burn it, Charles? Only think if this were theonly copy of the poem! Perhaps he wants to have it printed!""He is not going to print such stuff about any sister of mine!" said Mr.Rivenhall grimly, holding out an imperative hand.Lady Ombersley, always overborne by a stronger will, was just about to givethe paper to him when a trembling voice from the doorway arrested her,"Mama! Do not!"IILADY OMBERSLEY'S hand dropped; Mr. Rivenhall turned sharply, a frownon his brow. His sister, casting him a look of burning reproach, ran acrossthe room to her mother, and said, "Give it to me, Mama! What right hasCharles to burn my letters?"Lady Ombersley looked helplessly at her son, but he said nothing. Ceciliatwitched the open sheet of paper from her mother's fingers, and clasped it toher palpitating bosom. This did goad Mr. Rivenhall into speech. "For Godsake, Cecilia, let us have no play acting!" he said."How dared you read my letter?" she retorted."I did not read your letter! I gave it to Mama, and you will scarcely say thatshe had no right to read it!"Her soft blue eyes swam with tears; she said in a low voice, "It is all your fault!Mama would never--I hate you, Charles, I hate you!"He shrugged, and turned away. Lady Ombersley said feebly, "You should nottalk so, Cecilia! You know it is quite improper in you to be receiving letterswithout my knowledge! I do not know what your papa would say if he heardof it.""Papa!" exclaimed Cecilia scornfully. "No! It is Charles Who delights inmaking me unhappy!"He glanced over his shoulder at her. "It would be useless, I collect, to say thatmy earnest wish is that you should not be made unhappy."She returned no answer, but folded her letter with shaking hands, andbestowed it in her bosom, throwing a defiant look at him as she did so. It wasmet with one of contempt; Mr. Rivenhall propped his shoulders against themantelshelf, dug his hands into his breeches pockets, and waited sardonicallyfor what she might say next.She dried her eyes instead, catching her breath on little sobs. She was a verylovely girl, with pale golden locks arranged in ringlets about an exquisitelyshaped face, whose delicate complexion was at the moment heightened, notunbecomingly, by an angry flush. In general, her expression was one of sweetpensiveness, but the agitation of the moment had kindled a martial spark inher eyes, and she was gripping her underlip between her teeth in a way thatmade her look quite vicious. Her brother, cynically observing this, said thatshe should make a practice of losing her temper, since it improved her,lending animation to a countenance well enough in its way but a trifle insipid.This unkind remark left Cecilia unmoved. She could hardly fail to know thatshe was much admired, but she was a very modest girl quite unappreciative ofher own beauty, and would much have preferred to have been fashionablydark. She sighed, released her lip, and sat down on a low chair beside herMama's sofa, saying in a more moderate tone: "You cannot deny, Charles,that it is your doing that Mama has taken this--this unaccountable dislike toAugustus!""Now, there," said Lady Ombersley earnestly, "you are at fault, dearest, for Ido not dislike him at all! Only I cannot think him an eligible husband!""I don't care for that!" declared Cecilia. "He is the only man for whom I couldever feel that degree of attachment which--In short, I beg you will abandonany notion you may have that I could ever entertain Lord Charlbury'sextremely flattering proposal, for I never shall!"Lady Ombersley uttered a distressful but incoherent protest; Mr. Rivenhallsaid in his prosaic way, "Yet you were not, I fancy, so much averse fromCharlbury's proposal when it was first told you."Cecilia turned her lambent gaze upon him, and answered, "I had not then metAugustus."Lady Ombersley appeared to be a good deal struck by the logic of thispronouncement, but her son was less impressionable. He said, "Don't wastethese high flights on me, I beg of you! You have been acquainted with youngFawnhope any time these nineteen years!""It was not the same," said Cecilia simply."That," said Lady Ombersley, in a judicial way, "is perfectly true, Charles. Iam sure he was the most ordinary little boy, and when he was up at Oxford hehad the most dreadful spots, so that no one would have supposed he wouldgrow into such an excessively handsome young man! But the time he spent inBrussels with Sir Charles Stuart improved him out of all knowledge! I own, Inever should have known him for the same man!""I have sometimes wondered," retorted Mr. Rivenhall, "whether Sir Charleswill ever be the same man again either! How Lady Lutterworth can havereconciled it with her conscience to have foisted upon a public man such anincompoop to be his secretary I must leave it to herself to decide! All we areprivileged to know is that your precious Augustus no longer fills that office!Or any other!" he added trenchantly."Augustus," said Cecilia loftily, "is a poet. He is quite unfitted for the--thehumdrum business of an ambassador's secretary.""I do not deny it," said Mr. Rivenhall. "He is equally unfitted to support a wife,my dear sister. Do not imagine that I will frank you in this folly, for I tell younow I will not! And do not delude yourself into believing that you will obtainmy father's consent to this most imprudent match, for while I have anythingto say you will not!""I know well that it is only you who have anything to say in this house!" criedCecilia, large teardrops welling over her eyelids. "I hope that when you havedriven me to desperation you may be satisfied!"From the tightening of the muscles about his mouth it was to be seen that Mr.Rivenhall was making a praiseworthy effort to keep his none too amiabletemper in check. His mother glanced anxiously up at him, but the voice inwhich he answered Cecilia was almost alarmingly even. "Will you, my dearsister, have the goodness to reserve these Cheltenham tragedies for somemoment when I am not within hearing? And before you carry Mama awayupon the tide of all this rodomontade, may I be permitted to remind you thatso far from being forced into an unwelcome marriage you expressed yourwillingness to listen to what you have yourself described as Lord Charlbury'svery flattering offer?"Lady Ombersley leaned forward to take one of Cecilia's hands in hers, and tosqueeze it compassionately. "Well, you know, my dearest love, that is quitetrue!" she said. "Indeed, I thought you liked him excessively! You must notimagine that Papa or I have the least notion of compelling you to marryanyone whom you hold in aversion, for I am sure that such a thing would bequite shocking! And Charles would not do so either, would you, dearCharles?""No, certainly not. But neither would I consent to her marriage with any suchfrippery fellow as Augustus Fawnhope!""Augustus," announced Cecilia, putting up her chin, "will be remembered longafter you have sunk into oblivion!""By his creditors? I don't doubt it. Will that compensate you for a lifetimespent in dodging duns?"Lady Ombersley could not repress a shudder. "Alas, my love, it is too true!You cannot know the mortification--but we will not speak of that!""It is useless to speak to my sister of anything outside the covers of a novelfrom the lending library!" said Charles. "I might have supposed that shewould be thankful, in the state to which this family has been reduced, to havebeen on the point of contracting even a respectable alliance! But no! She isoffered not a respectable but a brilliant match, and she chooses to behave likeany Bath miss, swooning and languishing over a poet! A poet! Good God,Mama, if the specimen of his talent which you were so ill advised as to readme-- But I have no patience to argue further on that head! If you cannotprevail upon her to conduct herself in a manner worthy of her breeding shehad better be sent down to Ombersley, to rusticate for a while, and see if thatwill bring her to her senses!"With this terrible threat he strode out of the room, leaving his sister todissolve into tears, and his mother to recruit her strength through themedium of her vinaigrette.Between sobs Cecilia animadverted for some moments on the cruelty of fate,which had saddled her with a brother who was as heartless as he wastyrannical, and parents who were totally unable to enter into her feelings.Lady Ombersley, though sympathetic in the main, could not allow this topass. Without taking it upon herself to answer for her husband's sensibilities,she assured Cecilia that her own were extremely nice, making it perfectlypossible for her to appreciate the anguish of a forbidden love."When I was a girl, dearest, something of the same nature happened to me,"she said, sighing. "He was not a poet, of course, but I fancied myself verymuch in love with him. But it would not do, and in the end I was married toyour papa, which was thought to be a splendid match, for in those days hehad scarcely begun to run through his fortune, and--" She broke off, realizingthat these reminiscences were infelicitous. "In short, Cecilia--and I shouldnot be obliged to say this to you--persons of our order do not marry only toplease themselves."Cecilia was silenced, and could only hang down her head, dabbing at her eyeswith an already damp handkerchief. She knew herself to have been a gooddeal indulged through the fondness of one parent and the cheerfulindifference of the other, and was well aware that in discovering herinclination before permitting Lord Charlbury to address his suit to her LadyOmbersley had shown more consideration for her than would have beenapproved of by the greater part of her contemporaries. Cecilia might readnovels, but she knew that the spirited behavior of her favorite heroines wasnot for her to imitate. She foresaw that she was doomed to spinsterhood; andthis reflection was so melancholy that she drooped more than ever, and oncemore applied her handkerchief to her eyes."Only think how happy your sister is!" said Lady Ombersley, in a hearteningtone. "I am sure nothing could be more gratifying than to see her in her ownhome, with her dear baby, and James so attentive and obliging, and--andeverything just what one would wish! I declare I do not believe that any lovematch could have turned out better, not that I mean to say that Maria is notsincerely attached to James! But she had not met him above half-a-dozentimes when he asked Papa's leave to speak to her, and her affections were notengaged. Naturally, she felt a strong degree of liking, or I should never-- ButMaria was such a good, pretty-behaved girl! She told me herself that she felt itto be her duty to accept such a respectable offer, with Papa in suchdifficulties, and four more of you to be provided for!""Mama, I hope I am not an unnatural daughter, but I had rather be dead thanmarried to James!" declared Cecilia, raising her head. "He thinks of nothingbut hunting, and when they do not have company in the evening, he goes tosleep, and snores!"Daunted by this disclosure, Lady Ombersley could find nothing to say for aminute or two. Cecilia blew her nose, and added, "And Lord Charlbury iseven older than James!""Yes, but we do not know that he snores, my love," Lady Ombersley pointedout. "Indeed, we may be almost certain that he does hot, for his manners areso very gentlemanlike!""A man who would contract the mumps," declared Cecilia, "would doanything!"Lady Ombersley saw nothing unreasonable in this pronouncement, nor wasshe surprised that his lordship's unromantic behavior had given Cecilia adistaste for him. She had herself been sadly disappointed, for she hadthought him a man of sense, certainly not one to be succumbing to childishailments at inopportune moments. She could think of nothing to say topalliate his offense, and as Cecilia had apparently no further observations tomake, silence reigned uneasily for a time. Cecilia presently broke it, askingrather listlessly whether it was true that her uncle had been in the house thatafternoon. Glad of an excuse to talk of more cheerful matters, LadyOmbersley at once told her of the treat in store for her, and had thesatisfaction of seeing the cloud lift a little from her daughter's brow. It wasnot difficult to enlist Cecilia's sympathies on behalf of her cousin. She couldscarcely envisage a more horrid fate than to be sent to stay for an indefiniteperiod amongst relatives who were almost strangers, and warmly promised todo all that lay in her power to make Sophia feel herself at home in BerkeleySquare. She could conjure up no very clear recollection of her cousin, for ithad been some years since they had met; and although she had sometimesthought that to travel about Europe must be exciting, she had also suspectedthat it might also be extremely uncomfortable, and readily agreed with LadyOmbersley that such an unconventional existence was scarcely an idealpreparation for a London debut. The reflection that Sophia's arrival inBerkeley Square must mean some relaxation of the almost conventual lifeimposed upon the family by Charles's determination to economize sent heraway to change her dress for dinner in a far happier frame of mind.Four of the family sat down at the huge table in the dining room that evening,his lordship having decided to gratify his wife with one of his rareappearances at his own board. He was the only unconstrained member of theparty, for he had a happy disposition which made it possible for him to remainoblivious to the most blatant signs of discontent in his companions. In thesame spirit he contrived with amazing ease to be cheerful under thehumiliation of being little more than his son's pensioner. He had the greatestdread of being obliged to face unpleasantness, so he never allowed himself tothink about unpleasant things, which answered very well, and could besupported in times of really inescapable stress by his genius for persuadinghimself that any disagreeable necessity forced upon him by his own folly, orby his son's overriding will, was the outcome of his own choice and wisedecision. While Charles continued to render him the observances of filialrespect he was able to forget that the reins of government had been wrenchedout of his hands; and when, as sometimes happened, filial respect wore a littlethin, at least these regrettable lapses did not last for long, and were notdifficult for a man of his sanguine temperament to forget. He bore his son nomalice, though he thought him a dull dog; and provided that the luck wasrunning his way, and he was not expected to bear any distasteful part in themanagement of his young family, he was very well satisfied with his lot.He could hardly have been unaware of the dissension at present raging in hishousehold, for a request from his wife that he should exercise parentalauthority over Cecilia had driven him posthaste to Newmarket not a fortnightbefore. But neither his son's heavy frown nor his daughter's reddened eyelidsoccasioned the slightest comment from him. He appeared to derive no smallsatisfaction from partaking of a lengthy meal in the company of an anxiouswife, an injured daughter, and a glowering son. He said: "Well, upon my soul,this is very pleasant, to be dining en famille in this cozy way! You may tellyour cook, Lady Ombersley, that I like this way of serving a duck. I declare Idon't get as good at White's!" After that he recounted the latest piece ofsociety gossip, and inquired affably how his children had spent the day."If you mean me, Papa," said Cecilia, "I have spent the day just as I spendevery day. I shopped with Mama; I walked in the Park with my sisters andMiss Adderbury; and I practiced my music."Her tone did not suggest that she had found these amusements exhilarating,but Lord Ombersley said, "Capital!" and turned his attention to his wife. Shetold him of her brother's visit, and of his proposal that she should assume thecharge of Sophia; and Lord Ombersley gave his gracious consent to thescheme, saying that nothing could be better, and congratulating his daughterupon her good luck in so unexpectedly acquiring a charming companion.Charles, who was irritated enough by all this bland insensibility to sympathizewith his sister, said dampingly that they had as yet no reason to suppose thatSophia would be in the least charming. But Lord Ombersley said that heentertained no doubts on that head, and added that they must all do their bestto make their cousin's stay agreeable. After that he asked Charles whether heintended to go to the races next day. Charles, who knew that the racesreferred to were run under the patronage of the Duke of York, and wouldentail, for that jovial personage's cronies, several evenings spent at Oatlands,playing whist for pound points, looked more forbidding than ever, and saidthat he was going down to Ombersley Park for a few days."To be sure you are!" agreed his father cheerfully. "I was forgetting thatbusiness about the South Hanger. Yes, yes, I wish you would attend to that,my boy!""I will, sir," responded Mr. Rivenhall politely. He then glanced across thetable at his sister, and asked, "Do you care to accompany me, Cecilia? I amvery willing to take you, if you should like it."She hesitated. This might be an olive branch; on the other hand it might be asingularly futile attempt to wean her mind from thoughts of Mr. Fawnhope.The reflection that Charles's absence from town might, with a littlecontrivance, make it possible for her to meet Mr. Fawnhope decided thematter. She shrugged, and said, "No, I thank you. I do not know what Ishould do in the country at this season.""Ride with me," suggested Charles."I prefer to ride in the Park. If you desire company, I wonder you do notinvite the children to go with you. I am sure they would be delighted to obligeyou.""As you please," he replied indifferently. Dinner at an end, Lord Ombersleywithdrew from the family circle. Charles, who had no evening engagement,accompanied his mother and sister to the drawing room, and, while Ceciliastrummed idly at the piano, sat talking to his mother about Sophia's visit.Much to her relief, he seemed to be resigned to the necessity of holding atleast one moderate party in Sophia's honor, but he strongly advised heragainst charging herself with the office of finding a suitable husband for herniece."Why my uncle, having allowed her to reach the age of--twenty, is it?--withoutbestirring himself in the matter," he said, "must suddenly take it into his headto persuade you to undertake the business, is a matter beyond mycomprehension.""It does seem odd," agreed Lady Ombersley. "I daresay he might not haverealized how time flies, you know. Twenty! Why, she is almost upon theshelf! I must say, Horace has been most remiss! There could be no difficulty,I am sure, for she must be quite an heiress! Even if she were a very plain girl,which I do not for a moment suppose she can be, for you will allow Horace tobe a handsome man, while poor dear Marianne was excessively pretty, thoughI don't expect that you can remember her--well, even if she were plain, itshould be the easiest thing in the world to arrange a respectable match forher!""Very easy, but you would do well to leave it to my uncle, ma'am," was all hewould say.At this moment, the schoolroom party came into the room, escorted by MissAdderbury, a little gray mouse of a woman, who had originally been hired totake charge of Lady Ombersley's numerous offspring when Charles and Mariahad been adjudged old enough to leave Nurse's jealous care. It might havebeen supposed that a twenty-year residence in the household, under the aegisof a kindhearted mistress, and the encouragement of her pupils' affection,would long since have allayed Miss Adderbury's nervousness, but this hadendured with the years. Not all her accomplishments--and these included,besides a sufficient knowledge of Latin to enable her to prepare little boys forschool, the expert use of the globes, a thorough grounding in the theory ofmusic, enough proficiency upon the pianoforte and the harp to satisfy all butthe most exacting, and considerable talent in the correct use of water colors--made it possible for her to enter the drawing room without an inwardshrinking, or to converse with her employer on terms of equality. Those ofher pupils who had outgrown her care found her shyness and her anxiety toplease tiresome, but they could never forget her kindness to them in theirschoolroom days, and always treated her with something more than civility.So Cecilia smiled at her, and Charles said, "Well, Addy, and how are youtoday?" which slight attentions made her grow pink with pleasure, andstammer a good deal in her replies.Her charges now numbered three only, for Theodore, the youngest son of thehouse, had lately been sent to Eton. Selina, a sharp-looking damsel ofsixteen, went to sit beside her sister on the pianoforte stool; and Gertrude,bidding fair at twelve to rival Cecilia in beauty, and Amabel, a stout ten-yearold,cast themselves upon their brother, with loud professions of delight atseeing him, and rather louder reminders to him of a promise he had madethem to play at lottery tickets the very next time he should spend an eveningat home. Miss Adderbury, kindly invited by Lady Ombersley to take a seat bythe fire, made faint clucking noises in deprecation of this exuberance. Shehad no hope of being attended to, but was relieved to observe that LadyOmbersley was regarding the group about Charles with a fond smile. LadyOmbersley, in fact, was wishing that Charles, who was so popular with thechildren, could bring himself to be equally kind to the brother and sisternearer to him in age. There had been a rather painful scene at Christmas,when poor Hubert's Oxford debts had been discovered.The card table had been set up, and Amabel was already counting out themother-of-pearl fishes on its green baize cloth. Cecilia begged to be excusedfrom joining in the game, and Selina, who would have liked to play but alwaysmade a point of following her sister's example, said that she found lotterytickets a dead bore. Charles paid no heed to this, but as he passed behind themusic stool on his way to fetch the playing cards from a tall marquetry chest,bent to say something in Cecilia's ear. Lady Ombersley, anxiously watching,could not hear what it was, but she saw, her heart sinking, that it had theeffect of making Cecilia color up to the roots of her hair. However, she rosefrom the stool, and went to the table, saying very well, she would play for alittle while. So Selina relented too, and after a very few minutes both youngladies were making quite as much noise as their juniors, and laughing enoughto make an impartial observer think that the one had forgotten her advancedyears and the other her lacerated sensibilities. Lady Ombersley was able towithdraw her attention from the table and to settle down to a comfortablechat with Miss Adderbury.Miss Adderbury had already heard from Cecilia of Sophia's proposed visit andwas all eagerness to discuss it with Lady Ombersley. She could enter into herladyship's feelings upon the event, join her in sighing over the melancholysituation of a girl left motherless at five years old, agree with her plans forSophia's accommodation and amusement, and, while deploring theirregularity of Sophia's upbringing, feel sure that she would be found to be avery sweet girl."I always know I can rely upon you, Miss Adderbury," said Lady Ombersley."Such a comfort to me!"In what way she was to be relied on Miss Adderbury had no idea, but she didnot ask enlightenment, which was just as well, since her ladyship had no ideaeither, and had merely uttered the gratifying phrase from a general desire toplease. Miss Adderbury said, "Oh, Lady Ombersley! So good--! So veryobliging--!" and was almost ready to burst into tears at the thought of so muchconfidence being placed in one so unworthy as herself. Most fervently did shehope that her ladyship would never discover that she had nursed a snake inher bosom; and dolefully did she regret the lack of resolution that made itimpossible for her to withstand her dear Miss Rivenhall's coaxing. Only twodays before she had permitted young Mr. Fawnhope to join the walking partyin the Green Park, and, far worse, had made no objection to his falling behindwith Cecilia. It was true that Lady Ombersley had not mentioned Cecilia'sunhappy infatuation to her, much less laid commands upon her to repulse Mr.Fawnhope, but Miss Adderbury was the daughter of a clergyman (mercifullydeceased) of stern and rigid morals, and she knew that such quibbling merelyaggravated her depravity.These reflections were interrupted by a further observation made by herladyship in a lowered tone and with a glance cast toward the card table at theother end of the room. "I am persuaded that I have no need to tell you, MissAdderbury, that we have been made a trifle uneasy lately by one of thosefancies which young females are subject to. I shall say no more, but you willappreciate how glad I shall be to welcome my niece. Cecilia has been toomuch alone, and her sisters are not of an age to be the companions which hercousin must be. I am hopeful that in striving to make dear Sophia feel athome amongst us--for the poor little thing will be sadly lost in the middle ofsuch a large family, I daresay--and in showing her how she should go on inLondon, she will have enough to occupy her to give her thoughts anotherdirection."This view of the matter had not until now presented itself to Miss Adderbury,but she grasped it eagerly, and felt sure that all would happen precisely asLady Ombersley anticipated. "Oh, yes, indeed!" she declared. "Nothing couldbe better! So condescending of your ladyship to--I had collected from dearMiss Rivenhall--but she is such a sweet girl I know she will devote herself toher less fortunate cousin! When do you expect Miss Stanton-Lacy, dear LadyOmbersley?""Sir Horace was able to give me no very precise information," replied LadyOmbersley, "but I understand that he expects to sail for South America almostimmediately. No doubt my niece will be in London very shortly. Indeed, Ishall speak to the housekeeper tomorrow about preparing a bedchamber forher."IIIBUT it was not until the Easter holidays were a week old that Sophia arrivedin Berkeley Square. The only intelligence received by her aunt during theintervening ten days was a brief scrawl from Sir Horace, conveying theinformation that his mission was a trifle delayed, but that she would assuredlysee her niece before very long. The flowers which Cecilia so prettily arrangedin her cousin's room withered and had to be thrown away; and Mrs. Ludstock,a meticulously careful housekeeper, had twice aired the sheets before, in themiddle of a bright spring afternoon, a post chaise and four, generouslysplashed with mud, drew up at the door.It so happened that Cecilia and Selina had been driving with their Mama inthe Park, and had returned to the house not five minutes earlier. All threewere just about to ascend the staircase when Mr. Hubert Rivenhall camebounding down, uttering, "It must be my cousin, for there is a mountain ofbaggage on the roof! Such a horse! By Jupiter, if ever I saw such a bang-uppiece of flesh and blood!"This extraordinary speech made the three ladies stare at him in bewilderment.The butler, who had only a minute before withdrawn from the hall, sailedback again with his attendant satellites, and trod across the marble floor tothe front door, announcing, with a bow to his mistress, that he apprehendedMiss Stanton-Lacy had that instant arrived. The satellites then threw openthe double door, and the ladies had a clear view not only of the equipage inthe road but of the awed and inquisitive faces of the younger members of thefamily, who had been playing at bat-and-ball in the garden of the Square andwere now crowded close to the railings, gazing, in spite of Miss Adderbury'sremonstrances, at the animal which had brought Hubert in such pelting hastedown the stairs.Miss Stanton-Lacy's arrival was certainly impressive. Four steaming horsesdrew her chaise, two outriders accompanied it, and behind it rode a middleagedgroom, leading a splendid black horse. The steps of the chaise were letdown, the door opened, and out leaped an Italian greyhound, to be followed amoment later by a gaunt-looking female, holding a dressing bag, threeparasols, and a bird cage. Lastly, Miss Stanton-Lacy herself descended,thanking the footman for his proffered help, but requesting him instead tohold her poor little Jacko. Her poor little Jacko was seen to be a monkey in ascarlet coat, and no sooner had this magnificent fact dawned on theschoolroom party than they brushed past their scandalized preceptress, toreopen the garden gate, and tumbled out into the road, shouting, "A monkey!She has brought a monkey!"Lady Ombersley, meanwhile, standing as though rooted to her own doorstep,was realizing, with strong indignation, that the light in which a gentleman ofgreat height and large proportions regarded his daughter had been misleading.Sir Horace's little Sophy stood five feet nine inches in her stocking feet, andwas built on generous lines, a long-legged, deep-bosomed creature, with amerry face, and a quantity of glossy brown ringlets under one of the mostdashing hats her cousins had ever seen. A pelisse was buttoned up to herthroat, a very long sable stole was slipping from her shoulders, and she carriedan enormous sable muff. This, however, she thrust into the second footman'shands so that she was the better able to greet Amabel, who was the first toreach her. Her dazed aunt watched her stoop gracefully over the little girl,catching her hands, and saying laughingly, "Yes, yes, indeed I am your cousinSophia, but pray won't you call me Sophy? If anyone calls me Sophia I think Iam in disgrace, which is a very uncomfortable thing. Tell me your name!""It's Amabel, and oh, if you please, may I talk to the monkey?" stammered theyoungest Miss Rivenhall."Of course you may, for I brought him for you. Only be a little gentle withhim at first, because he is shy, you know.""Brought him for me?" gasped Amabel, quite pale with excitement."For you all," said Sophy, embracing Gertrude and Theodore in her warmsmile. "And also the parrot. Do you like pets better than toys and books? Ialways did, so I thought very likely you would too.""Cousin!" said Hubert, breaking in on the fervent assurances of his juniorsthat their new relative had gauged their tastes with an accuracy utterlyunequaled in all their experience of adults. "Is that your horse?"She turned, surveying him with a certain unselfconscious candor, the smilestill lingering on her mouth. "Yes, that is Salamanca. Do you like him?""By Jove, I should think I do! Is he Spanish? Did you bring him fromPortugal?""Cousin Sophy, what is your dear little dog's name? What kind of a dog is it?""Cousin Sophy, can the parrot talk? Addy, may we keep it in theschoolroom?""Mama, Mama, Cousin Sophy has brought us a monkey!"This last shout, from Theodore, made Sophy look quickly round. Perceivingher aunt and her two other cousins in the doorway, she ran up the steps,exclaiming, "Dear Aunt Elizabeth! I beg your pardon! I was making friendswith the children! How do you do? I am so happy to be with you! Thank youfor letting me come to you!"Lady Ombersley was still dazed, still clutching feebly at the fast vanishingpicture of the shy little niece of her imaginings, but at these words that insipiddamsel was cast into the limbo of things unregretted and unremembered. Sheclasped Sophy in her arms, raising her face to the glowing one above her, andsaying tremulously, "Dear, dear Sophy! So happy! So like your father!Welcome, dear child, welcome!"She was quite overcome, and it was several moments before she couldrecollect herself enough to introduce Sophy to Cecilia and Selina. Sophystared at Cecilia, and exclaimed: "Are you Cecilia? But you are so beautiful!Why don't I remember that?"Cecilia, who had been feeling quite overpowered, began to laugh. You couldnot suspect Sophy of saying things like that only to please you. She saidexactly what came into her head. "Well, I did not remember either!" sheretorted. "I thought you were a little brown cousin, all legs and tangled hair!""Yes, but I am--oh, not tangled, perhaps, but all legs, I assure you, anddreadfully brown! I have not, grown into a beauty! Sir Horace tells me I mustabandon all pretensions--and he is a judge, you know!"Sir Horace was right. Sophy would never be a beauty. She was by far too tall;nose and mouth were both too large; and a pair of expressive gray eyes couldscarcely be held to atone entirely for these defects. Only you could not forgetSophy, even though you could not recall the shape of her face or the color ofher eyes.She had turned again toward her aunt. "Will your people direct John Pottonwhere he may stable Salamanca, ma'am? Only for tonight! And a room forhimself? I shall arrange everything just as soon as I have learnt my wayabout!"Mr. Hubert Rivenhall made haste to assure her that he would himself conductJohn Potton to the stables. She smiled, and thanked him, and LadyOmbersley said that there was room and to spare for Salamanca in the stables,and she must not trouble her head about such matters. But it seemed thatSophy was determined to trouble her head, for she answered quickly, "No, no,my horses are not to be a charge on you, dear aunt! Sir Horace mostparticularly charged me to make my own arrangements, if I should be settingup my stable, and indeed I mean to do so! But for tonight it would be so kindof you!"There was enough here to set her aunt's brain reeling. What kind of a niecewas this, who set up her stable, made her own arrangements, and called herfather Sir Horace? Then Theodore created a diversion, coming up with thescared monkey clasped in his arms, demanding that she should tell Addy thathe might take it to the schoolroom, since Cousin Sophy had given it to them.Lady Ombersley shrank from the monkey, and said feebly, "My love, I don'tthink--oh, dear, whatever will Charles say?""Charles is not such a muff as to be afraid of a monkey!" declared Theodore."Oh, Mama, pray tell Addy we may keep it!""Indeed, Jacko will not bite anyone!" Sophy said. "I have had him with me forclose on a week, and he is the gentlest creature! You will not banish him,Miss--Miss Addy? No, I know that is wrong!""Miss Adderbury, but we always call her Addy!" Cecilia explained."How do you do?" Sophy said, holding out her hand. "Forgive me! It wasimpertinent, but I did not know! Do permit the children to keep poor Jacko!"Between her dismay at having a monkey thrust upon her and her desire toplease this glowing girl, who smiled so kindly down at her and extended herhand with such frank good nature, Miss Adderbury lost herself in a morass ofhalf-sentences. Lady Ombersley said that they must ask Charles, a remarkwhich was at once interpreted as permission to take Jacko up to theschoolroom at once, none of the children thinking so poorly of their brotheras to believe that he would raise the least objection to their new pet. Sophywas then led up to the Blue Saloon, where she at once cast her sables onto achair, unbuttoned her pelisse, and tossed off her modish hat. Her aunt,fondly drawing her down to sit beside her on the sofa, asked her if she weretired from the long journey, and if she would like to take some refreshment."No, indeed! Thank you, but I am never tired, and although it was a trifletedious, I could not count it as a journey!" Sophy replied. "I should have beenwith you this morning, only that I was obliged to go first to Merton.""Go first to Merton?" echoed Lady Ombersley. "But why, my love? Have youacquaintances there?""No, no, but Sir Horace particularly desired it!""My dear, do you always call you papa Sir Horace?" asked Lady Ombersley.The gray eyes began to dance again. "No, if he makes me very cross I call himPapa!" Sophy said. "It is of all things what he most dislikes! Poor angel, it is agreat deal too bad that he should be saddled with such a maypole for adaughter, and no one could expect him to bear it!" She perceived that heraunt was looking a little shocked, and added, with her disconcertingfrankness, "You don't like that. I am so sorry, but indeed he is a delightfulparent, and I love him dearly! But it is one of his maxims, you know, that oneshould never allow one's partiality to blind one to a person's defects."The startling proposition that a daughter should be encouraged to take noteof her father's faults so much horrified Lady Ombersley that she could thinkof nothing to say. Selina, who liked to get to the root of everything, askedwhy Sir Horace had particularly desired Sophy to go to Merton."Only to take Sancia to her new home," Sophy explained. "That was why yousaw me with those absurd outriders. Nothing will convince poor Sancia thatEnglish roads are not infested with bandits and guerilleros!""But who is Sancia?" demanded Lady Ombersley, in some bewilderment."Oh, she is the Marquesa de Villacañas! Did Sir Horace not tell you hername? You will like her; indeed, you must like her! She is quite stupid, anddreadfully indolent, like all Spaniards, but so pretty and good natured!" Shesaw that her aunt was now wholly perplexed, and her straight, rather thickbrows drew together. "You don't know? He did not tell you? Now, howinfamous of him! Sir Horace is going to marry Sancia.""What?" gasped Lady Ombersley.Sophy leaned forward to take her hand, and to press it coaxingly. "Yes,indeed he is, and you must be glad, if you please, because she will suit himvery well. She is a widow, and extremely wealthy.""A Spaniard!" said Lady Ombersley. "He never breathed a word of this tome!""Sir Horace says that explanations are so tedious," said Sophy excusingly. "Idaresay he might have felt that it would take too long. Or," she added, amischievous look in her eyes, "that I would do it for him!""I never heard of such a thing!" said Lady Ombersley, almost roused to wrath."Just like Horace! And when, pray, my dear, does he mean to marry thisMarquesa?""Well," said Sophy seriously, "that, I fancy, is why he did not care to explain itall to you. Sir Horace cannot marry Sancia until I am off his hands. It is soawkward for him, poor dear! I have promised to do my best, but I cannotengage to marry anyone I don't like! He understands my feelings perfectly. Iwill say this for Sir Horace, that he is never unreasonable!"Lady Ombersley was strongly of the opinion that these remarks were quiteunsuited to her daughters' ears, but she saw no way of stemming them.Selina, still delving to the roots, asked, "Why cannot your papa be marrieduntil you are, Sophy?""On account of Sancia," replied Sophy readily. "Sancia says she does not atall wish to be my stepmama."Lady Ombersley was smitten to the heart. "My poor child!" she said, laying ahand on Sophy's knee. "You are so brave, but you may confide in me! She isjealous of you. I believe all Spaniards have the most shockingly jealousnatures! It is too bad of Horace! If I had known this! Is she unkind, Sophy?Does she dislike you'Sophy went off into a peal of laughter. "Oh, no, no, no! I am sure she neverdisliked anyone in all her life! The thing is that if she married Sir Horacewhile I am still on his hands everyone will expect her to behave to me like amama, and she is much too lazy! Then, too, with the best will in the world, Imight continue to manage Sir Horace, and his house and everything that Ihave been accustomed to do. We have talked it over, and I can't but see thatthere is a great deal in what she says. But as for jealousy, no indeed! She ismuch too handsome to be jealous of me, and much too good natured as well.She says that she has the greatest imaginable affection for me, but share ahouse with me she will not. I do not blame her. Pray do not think I blameher!""She sounds a very odd sort of a woman," said Lady Ombersleydisapprovingly. "And why does she live in Merton?""Oh, Sir Horace hired the prettiest villa for her there! She means to liveretired until he comes back to England. That," said Sophy, with a gurgle ofmirth, "is because she is excessively idle. She will lie in bed until the morningis half gone, eat a great many sweetmeats, read a great many novels, and beperfectly pleased to see any of her friends who will give themselves the troubleof driving out to visit her. Sir Horace says she is the most restful female of hisacquaintance." She bent to stroke her little dog, which had all the time beensitting at her feet. "Except Tina here, of course! Dear ma'am, I hope you donot dislike dogs? She is very good, I promise you, and I could not part withher!"Lady Ombersley assured her that she had no objection to dogs, but was by nomeans partial to monkeys. Sophy laughed, and said, "Oh, dear! Was it wrongof me to bring him for the children? Only when I saw him, in Bristol, heseemed to me to be just the thing! And now that I have given him to them, Idaresay it will be difficult to persuade them to give him up."Lady Ombersley rather thought that it would be impossible, and as there didnot seem to be anything more to be said on that subject, and she was feelingquite bemused by her niece's various disclosures, she suggested that Ceciliashould escort Sophy up to her room, where she would no doubt like to restfor awhile before changing her dress for dinner.Cecilia rose with alacrity, ready to add her persuasions to her mother's if itshould be necessary. She did not suppose that Sophy wished to rest, for thelittle she had seen of her cousin had been enough to convince her that acreature so full of vitality rarely stood in need of rest. But she felt herselfstrongly drawn to Sophy and was anxious to make a friend of her as soon aspossible. So when it was discovered that Sophy's maid was unpacking hertrunks in her bedchamber, she begged Sophy to come to her own room for achat. Selina, finding that she was not to be admitted to this tête-á-tête,pouted, but went off, deriving consolation from the reflection that to herwould fall the agreeable task of describing to Miss Adderbury every detail ofSophy's conversation in the Blue Saloon.Cecilia's disposition was shy, and although her manners lacked the forbiddingreserve which distinguished those of her elder brother, they were neverconfiding. Yet within a very few minutes she found herself pouring into hercousin's ears some at least of the evils of her situation. Sophy listened to herwith interest and sympathy, but the constant recurrence of Mr. Rivenhall'sname seemed to puzzle her, and she presently interrupted to say, "I beg yourpardon, but this Charles--is he not your brother?""My eldest brother," said Cecilia."Well, that is what I collected. But what has he to say to anything?"Cecilia sighed. "You will soon discover, Sophy, that nothing may be done inthis house without Charles's sanction. It is he who orders everything,arranges everything, and rules everything!""Now, let me understand this!" said Sophy. "My uncle has not died, has he? Iam sure Sir Horace never told me so!""Oh, no! But Papa-- I should not be talking about him, and of course I don'tknow precisely--but I think poor Papa found himself in difficulties! In fact, Iknow it was so, for I found my mother in great distress once, and she told mea little, because she was so distracted she hardly knew what she was doing. Ingeneral, she would never say a word about Papa to any of us--except Charles, Isuppose, and I daresay Maria, now that she is a married lady. Only then mygreat-uncle Matthew died, and he left all his fortune to Charles, and I don'tunderstand exactly how it was, but I believe Charles did something withmortgages. Whatever it was, it .seems to have placed poor Papa quite in hispower. And I am very certain that it is Charles who pays for Hubert andTheodore, besides settling all the debts, for that Mama did tell me.""Dear me, how very uncomfortable it must be for your Papa!" remarkedSophy. "My cousin Charles sounds a most disagreeable creature!""He is quite odious!" said Cecilia. "I sometimes think he takes a delight inmaking everyone miserable, for I am sure he grudges us the least pleasure, andis only anxious to marry us to respectable men with large fortunes, who arequite middle-aged, and sober, and can do nothing but catch the mumps!"Since Sophy was far too intelligent to suppose that this embittered speech wasa mere generalization, she at once pressed Cecilia to tell her more about therespectable man with mumps, and after a little hesitation, and a good deal ofcircumlocution, Cecilia not only divulged that a marriage between herself andLord Charlbury had been arranged (though not as yet announced), butfavored her with a word picture of the Honorable Augustus Fawnhope whichmust have seemed like the ravings of delirium to anyone who had not beenprivileged to behold that beautiful young man. But Sophy had already met Mr.Fawnhope, and instead of coaxing her cousin to lie down upon her bed with acooling draught, she said in the most matter-of-fact way, "Yes, very true. Ihave never seen Lord Byron, but they tell me that he is nothing to Mr.Fawnhope. He is quite the most handsome man I think I ever saw.""You know Augustus!" Cecilia breathed, clasping her hands at her palpitatingbosom."Yes--that is to say, I am acquainted with him. I fancy I danced with him onceor twice at the balls in Brussels last year. Was he not attached to Sir CharlesStuart in some capacity or another?""One of his secretaries, but Augustus is a poet, and of course he has no headfor business, or affairs, which is a circumstance that disgusts Charles morethan all the rest, I believe! Oh, Sophy, when we met--it was at Almack'sAssembly Rooms, and I was wearing a gown of palest blue satin, embroideredall over with silken rosebuds, and knots of silver twist--we no sooner saw eachother than--he has assured me that it was the same with him! How could Isuppose that there would be the least objection? The Fawnhopes, you know!I daresay they have been here since the Conquest, or some such thing! If I donot care a button for such things as fortunes or titles, what concern is it ofCharles's?""None at all," said Sophy briskly. "Dear Cecilia, don't cry, I beg of you! Onlytell me this! Does your mama dislike the notion of your marrying Mr.Fawnhope?""Dearest Mama has such sensibility that I know she must feel for me!"declared Cecilia, obediently drying her eyes. "She has as good as told me so,but she dare not withstand Charles! That, Sophy, is what governs all in thishouse!""Sir Horace is always right!" declared Sophy, rising, and shaking out herskirts. "I teased him to take me to Brazil, you know, because, to own thetruth, I could not imagine how I should contrive to occupy myself in London,with nothing to do but amuse myself in my aunt's house! He assured me that Ishould find something to be busy with, and you see that he had gauged thematter exactly! I wonder if he knew of all this? My dear Cecilia--oh, may I callyou Cecy instead? Cecilia! Such a mouthful! Only trust me! You have falleninto a fit of despondency, and there is not the least need! In fact, nothingcould be more fatal, in any predicament! It encourages one to suppose thatthere is nothing to be done, when a little resolution is all that is wanted tobring matters to a happy conclusion. I must go to my room, and dress fordinner, or I shall be late, and there is nothing more odious than a guest whocomes late to meals!""But, Sophy, what can you possibly mean?" gasped Cecilia. "What can you doto help me?"Sir Vincent, who had come into the hall with a couple of bottles, set themdown in the hearth, saying, "How do you do, Rivenhall? Sophy, is there anyink in the house? The poet is searching for some in the larder and driving mypoor Sancia distracted.""Talgarth," said Mr. Rivenhall, firmly grasping Sophy by one wrist, "I beg youwill take care of these infernal ducklings, and I wish you a very pleasantevening! Sir Horace has arrived in town, and I must instantly restore hisdaughter to him!""Rivenhall," said Sir Vincent gravely, "I perfectly understand you, and Iapplaud your presence of mind. Allow me to offer you my felicitations! I willconvey your apologies to my wife. Let me advise you to lose no time in takingyour departure! The poet will all too shortly return!""Sir Vincent!" cried Sophy, dragged irresistibly to the door. "Give myportmanteau to Miss Wraxton, and beg her to make what use she pleases ofthe contents! Charles, this is crazy! Did you come in your curricle? What ifit should begin to rain again? I shall be drenched!""Then you will be well served!" retorted her unchivalrous cousin."Charles!" uttered Sophy, shocked. "You cannot love me!"Mr. Rivenhall pulled the door to behind them, and in a very rough fashionjerked her into his arms, and kissed her. "I don't. I dislike you excessively!"he said savagely.Entranced by these lover like words, Miss Stanton-Lacy returned his embracewith fervor, and meekly allowed herself to be led off to the stables.
